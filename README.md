# SymmArt

Art from symmetric transformations in the spirit of Frank A. Farris. For more about the
mathematics in this package, see his book:

> Frank A. Farris. "Creating Symmetry: The Artful Mathematics of Wallpaper Patterns"
> *Princeton University Press* (2015)


* Free software: GNU General Public License v3
* Documentation: https://symmart.readthedocs.io.


## Usage

To experiment with Farris' symmetric functions, run the GUI:

```
python -m symmart
```

This starts a dash app on [http://localhost:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/).

There are also a number of jupyter notebooks provided in the `examples` directory.
Notebooks starting with 'Farris XX' attempt to replicate figures from the book
(using my own color-wheels).
